# Stroke Prediction using Random Forest
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the use of Random Forest algorithm for predicting stroke. The notebook includes the following steps:

1.) Data preprocessing: handling missing values, encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical variables.

2.) Model training and evaluation: training a Random Forest model, evaluating the model performance and calculating feature importance.

3.) Prediction probability: calculating the prediction probability for the test set.

4.) The data used in this notebook is a stroke prediction dataset. The goal of this project is to build a model with an accuracy of 93% to predict stroke.
